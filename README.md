## Overview

This project aims to help users reflect and document their daily successes, failures, and plan on what to do better the next day. You can check a live demo [here]().

## Technologies Used üõ†
---
* ES6
* NodeJS
* Express
* PostgreSQL

## Getting started :rocket::rocket::rocket:
---

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

### Run locally
- To run app locally, make sure you have `NodeJS`, `PostgreSQL` installed.
- Clone this repository

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/meetKazuki/reflections.git
    cd reflections
    npm install
  ```

- Create a database (I'm assuming you have installed PostgreSQL by now) either using `pgadmin` or by running the command on your terminal:

    ```bash
      createdb -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres reflection_db
    ```

- Configure `.env` environment variable with your credentials (at the root of the project folder)
- `npm run dev-start` to start the server and watch for file changes

### Testing
- You can test the api locally using [*Postman*](https://www.getpostman.com)
- Run `npm test` for automated testing (_please refer to issue 2_).

### HTTP Response Codes
- `200` `OK` The request was successful
- `400` `Bad Request` There was a problem with the request (security, malformed request)
- `404` `Not found` An attempt was made to access a resource that does not exist in the API
- `500` `Server Error` An error on the server occured

### Issues
---
1. A big part of this code is not functioning properly üò¢. For some reason, the token provided after you login is always invalid (I think it's a problem with the `Auth` middleware)
2. The tests also are not really comprehensive. I'm still struggling to get a hang of this TDD stuff üòø. Make it better if you can üòÑ.

### ToDo ‚úîÔ∏è
---
1. Fix issue with authentication
2. Set it up on Heroku
3. Implement a frontend
